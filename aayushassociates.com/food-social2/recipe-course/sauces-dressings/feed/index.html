<p>In this recipe, I&#8217;ve blended my favorite parts of guacamole and pico de gallo. This is an avocado and cilantro heavy mix, with a little tomato, and some heat from the jalapeno and red pepper. Some salt and lime juice round out the flavors. Mix in the avocado at the very end to preserve the nicely diced edges.</p>

<p>I love creating my own spice blends so I can make them with the perfect amount of saltiness, heat and overall flavoring! The best part, no nasty preservatives! It&#8217;s so easy and you will love how versatile this southwest seasoning is. It is so amazing for marinating meats or adding to potatoes for an extra zing of flavor! The options are endless. My favorite is marinating flank steak with this seasoning, avocado oil and lime juice overnight and then grilling it and making Southwest Steak Salads! Yummmm!</p>

<p>These Balsamic Strawberries were created to go over my <a href="https://foodsocial.io/recipe/balsamic-strawberries/%5C"><u>Lemon Basil Grilled Chicken</u></a> and are so darn delicious I wanted to give them their own place to shine! They have the perfect amount of tangy sweetness and only take about 15 minutes to come together. They would be yummy over fish, tomato feta salad, spinach salad with salmon, filet mignon or even ice cream! The options are endless.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>We have been making SO much salsa this summer and by SO much I really do mean a lot. We are super spoiled with the most amazing CSA and their tomatoes are basically heaven in a fruit. We basically don’t eat tomatoes if they are not in season anymore because they taste like mushy watery nastiness. You can throw all these ingredients in your food processor or blender and be done in less than 10 minutes. You can roughly chop it for a chunky salsa or you can puree more. Feel free to adjust flavor according to your preference.</p>
