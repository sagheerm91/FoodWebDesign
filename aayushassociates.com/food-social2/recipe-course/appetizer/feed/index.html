<h3>Instant Pot French Toast Recipe</h3>
<p>You may have made a cinnamon roll french toast casserole or french toast bake, but those can take a long time to make. With the instant pot craze going on, we thought we would try to shorten the preparation time needed for traditional french toast bakes! We love our instant pot and use it for dinners all the time. We have even used it for dessert with our Instant Pot Monkey Bread. The ease and quickness of it are perfect for our busy lifestyle.</p>
<p>I honestly had no idea that you could even make french toast in the instant pot! But it is really easy!Feel free to add in some fun additions like pecans, walnuts or chocolate chips! They are all great.</p>
<p>This will make the perfect dish for your Christmas Morning Brunch! Looking for some other great Christmas Morning Recipes? We have tons!!</p>

<p>These delicious and nutritious salmon cakes come together in a pinch and are rich in Indian flavors! These are inspired by flavors found in aloo tiki, a spiced potato patty topped with delicious chutneys commonly enjoyed in India. I’ve infused these flavors into a healthy salmon cake. You can use canned, wild caught salmon or tuna, and even sardines for this recipe. I love topping these savory cakes with my avocado chutney during whole30 for a meal that is filled with proteins and healthy fats. When I’m not on whole30, I enjoy it with a cooling yogurt sauce. Hope you enjoy this!</p>

<p>MEXICAN STREET CORN NACHOS!! I never need an excuse to eat Mexican Food, and even though today isn’t a real holiday, there is certainly a tradition of eating Mexican Food and drinking tequila on “Cinco De Mayo” here in the States. I can’t drink any alcohol this year, but you can still find me stuffing my face per usual! These nachos are perfectly cheesy and savory, with a hint of sweetness from the fire roasted corn. Assembling these is easy, just gather your ingredients, load on the toppings, and enjoy!!</p>

<p>I am one of those people who honestly love Cauliflower – I love it for what it is, and I also love it for everything it can become! I hadn’t made anything with Cauliflower for a few months but my adoration for this cruciferous veggie is back and in the form of little Pepperoni Pizza Cauliflower Bites! These little grain-free snacks are easy enough to make for a relaxing day in, yet fancy enough to add to your game day spread!</p>
