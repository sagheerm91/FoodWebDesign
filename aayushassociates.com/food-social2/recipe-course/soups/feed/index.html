<p>Today I am bringing another of our ever popular and a classic bowl of confort food! Like our simple dhal, Rajma (the red kidney beans) is an emotion. Every family has their own version of it and trust me every version is delicious because this is what childhood memories are made of.This bowl of Rajma is a soul lifter for any day of the week. Absolutely bursting with flavor and comforting during the chilly evenings.</p>



<p>The flavor burst to this recipe comes from simple herbs, spices and more so from the slow sautéing. Trust me, a little patience during sautéing is all it takes to build flavors in Indian recipes. practice that and you’ll be a pro at any Indian dish including this one.</p>

<p>Minestrone soup is simple yet healthy and hearty. Grab your favorite vegetables, beans, gluten-free quinoa pasta, and let your slow cooker do the work. What I love about minestrone soup is that you really can’t screw it up. You’re encouraged to use whatever vegetables are in season.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Looking for another easy but delicious way to cook Fish, then this Caribbean Fish Stew is for you. Growing up there were two types of stews that my mom made. Brown stew—where burnt sugar (a dark brown sugar caramel) was used to give the stew a rich brown color. And red stew or tomato paste stew—where tomatoes and tomato paste came together to give the stew a rich red color. I love any version of stew. Red stew with chicken is really yummy. And by the way we never called it red stew, we simply called it stew.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>If you have followed me for a while then you know I ADORE a recipe that is healthy and flexible. I think one of the best ways to help people cook more at home is to offer recipes that are not so rigid.</p>



<p>Cooking is a passion. Cooking is life. Cooking is creative. Cooking is instinctive.</p>



<p>But often if you aren’t a person who loves to cook you get overwhelmed with feeling like you have to stick right to a recipe, you have to measure carefully and buy exactly what it calls for or it will fail. If that is you then try this recipe, you’ll prepare a highly nutritious meal without stress!</p>



<p>Buy other veggies that are in season or that you love. Buy veggies you think your family (kids especially) will eat. The goal is to have at lease 4 different vegetables. If you don’t have all the spices then just do your best.</p>



<p>Taste as you go, taste to see what your instinct tells you might be a great addition. Have fun. Use the knowledge gained and carry it forward into he next meal. Bon appetit</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Lemon Coriander soup is a clear soup made with refreshing ingredients such as fresh lemon juice, fresh coriander (cilantro) and veggies. The recipe is vegetarian but you can substitute the vegetable broth with chicken broth and add some shredded chicken to the soup for added nutrition. I love sipping this soup on a rainy day or when I&#8217;m down with a flu as it is such a great immunity booster due to the Vitamin C from lemon juice. This soup is also Whole30 compatible, Paleo, Gluten-free and Dairy-free.</p>
