										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Oh how I&#8217;ve missed a good sandwich since going grain and gluten free, and one of my favorites is a tuna or chicken salad sandwich. This curried tuna salad is creamy, savory and sweet, and has amazing texture thanks to the little pieces of apple in between. This is easy and satisfying and definitely a go-to meal for me during a busy week.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Jamaican fricassee chicken is a stew very similar to brown stew chicken. The chicken is seasoned with simple ingredients then browned and stewed down until the chicken is tender. My mom made this a lot growing up as she preferred it over brown stew chicken. While it is delicious right after it’s done cooking, it’s even better the next day. I made this recipe gluten free, but it can also be made Whole30 and Paleo.</p>
