<p>Jamaican fricassee chicken is a stew very similar to brown stew chicken. The chicken is seasoned with simple ingredients then browned and stewed down until the chicken is tender. My mom made this a lot growing up as she preferred it over brown stew chicken. While it is delicious right after it’s done cooking, it’s even better the next day. I made this recipe gluten free, but it can also be made Whole30 and Paleo.</p>

<p>These Balsamic Strawberries were created to go over my <a href="https://foodsocial.io/recipe/balsamic-strawberries/%5C"><u>Lemon Basil Grilled Chicken</u></a> and are so darn delicious I wanted to give them their own place to shine! They have the perfect amount of tangy sweetness and only take about 15 minutes to come together. They would be yummy over fish, tomato feta salad, spinach salad with salmon, filet mignon or even ice cream! The options are endless.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Looking for another easy but delicious way to cook Fish, then this Caribbean Fish Stew is for you. Growing up there were two types of stews that my mom made. Brown stew—where burnt sugar (a dark brown sugar caramel) was used to give the stew a rich brown color. And red stew or tomato paste stew—where tomatoes and tomato paste came together to give the stew a rich red color. I love any version of stew. Red stew with chicken is really yummy. And by the way we never called it red stew, we simply called it stew.</p>

<p>This Hot corn dip is cheesy, creamy, a little spicy (which can be ofcourse adjusted to your liking!) and a party-pleaser for sure! You can make this using fresh, canned or frozen corn but what intensifies the flavor is actually toasting that corn. Serve bubbly hot with some crackers, tortilla chips, pita chips or crusty bread.</p>

<p>It is no secret that I am obsessed with Cava right now. We moved and live less than 5 minutes from one and we can’t get enough. One of my favorite things at Cava is the harissa, which is a spicy roasted red chili paste. In attempt to save us some money and for those of you that don’t live close to a Cava, I made this Harissa Marinated Chicken. It is the perfect weeknight meal and is really simple to make.</p>
