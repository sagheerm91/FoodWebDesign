<p>Crispy, crunchy croutons on top of a fresh salad is the best! These Plantain Croutons are super easy made in the air fryer and hard not to gobble up before they get on the salad! Just 4 ingredients and 15 minutes to air fry and they are ready! If you are lucky enough to have leftovers, they keep well in a glass jar for several days!</p>

<p>This no-cook Shaved Brussels Sprouts salad is easy to put together and is a great way to use Brussels Sprouts when they are in season. You can prep this salad in advance, even with the dressing added&#8230; infact, I would recommend that because it allows the Brussels sprouts to soak up the flavors. Don&#8217;t worry the salad won&#8217;t get soggy as the hearty brussels sprouts hold up well, making it a perfect salad/appetizer to make or take to a party. It&#8217;s got a nice, refreshing tart &#8211; sweet dressing and the salty parmesan cheese just takes it to the next level. Hope you give it a try!</p>

<p>Fall is my favorite time of the year! I love the weather, the colors, and the holidays. But most importantly, I love the flavors, specifically the produce. That’s why this salad combo is one of my favorites and an absolute go-to. It’s packed with brussels sprouts, sweet potato, and apple and all brought together by a delicious spicy honey mustard vinaigrette.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>This recipe is a special tribute to our family &#8211; it&#8217;s a favorite! The salad uses light and crunchy butter lettuce as the base and has lots of great flavors and textures from craisins, candied pecans, crunchy cucumbers and shallots, tossed with a homemade balsamic vinaigrette dressing.  Like a lot of the salads we make, you can eat this as an accompaniment to a meal, or toss your favorite protein on top to make it a complete meal. This recipe is one I like to say that I &#8220;measure with my heart&#8221; &#8211; there are no true measures of ingredients that make it perfect &#8230; it&#8217;s whatever feels right.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Perfect for a weekend brunch or to prep ahead for the week, this Spring Pesto &amp; Potato Salad is a healthy, delicious side dish you’re going to want to save. You can use my Dairy-Free Pesto recipe, or whatever store-bought variation you choose. Just make sure to read the label, if you’re keeping things Whole30 friendly. This recipe is a cinch to make, and it can go from side dish to main with the addition of some sliced hard-boiled eggs.</p>
