<p>Spicy, creamy and tangy cilantro chutney is the star of the show in this Indian fusion recipe. Full fat Greek yogurt is combined with green chilies, garlic, cumin powder, lemon juice, salt and pepper to make a creamy, thick chutney that is the perfect consistency and replacement for traditional mayo-based potato salads. The creamy chutney hugs fork tender Yukon gold potatoes. This recipe is spicy, creamy and so flavorful! Perfect for your summer cookouts.</p>

<p>If your only exposure to Indian food is at Indian Restaurants in the US, you may not have eaten these simple vegetable stir fries that are an everyday staple in an Indian kitchen. These Indian style stir fries are super healthy, nutrient and fiber rich and packed with flavor from spices. They come together really quickly! I like to chop up veggies over the weekend or use frozen veggies so I can make these for busy weekday dinners. You will love loading up your plates with these fresh and yummy veggies!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>This Lemon, Dill and Asparagus Potato Salad basically remind me of all things Spring. I was so excited last week to go to the store and see piles of asparagus and beautiful radishes. I was inspired to use all those ingredients to make a potato salad with a lemon and dill vinaigrette. I have another potato salad on the blog with similar flavors but this one is packed full of more flavors and complexities. Probably my favorite part of this salad is the dressing. I really could pour that stuff on everything. I would recommend adding the radishes right before serving because they tend to bleed pink on the potato salad. Feel free to add any of your favorite veggies to the salad and enjoy!</p>

<p>This easy pan fried quick paneer recipe takes just 15 minutes to make and is so delicious and healthy. This can be a quick appetizer or side dish or a filling, whichever way your heart desires. My favorite way to have this paneer is as a filling to a wrap since you can maximize the limited quantity of the cooked paneer. It also makes for an amazing pizza topping.</p>
