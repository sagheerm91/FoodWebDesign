Kugel is often made with noodles, but noodles and breads are avoided on Passover, so potatoes take their place for a delicious casserole that can be enjoyed along side your other dishes like a brisket, or roast chicken, and matzo ball soup. Potato Kugel is typically shredded, but we made ours a little differently because I made the mistake of putting the food processor blade on wrong. We ended up really liking the texture, so we went with it! We added onion and fresh herbs to flavor this Potato Kugel, and topped it with sour cream, course salt and black pepper, and chopped chives. It was delicious!<\/p>\n <!--WPRM Recipe 759-->\n<div class=\"wprm-fallback-recipe\">\n\t<h2 class=\"wprm-fallback-recipe-name\">Passover Potato Kugel<\/h2>\n\t<img decoding=\"async\" class=\"wprm-fallback-recipe-image\" src=\"https:\/\/aayushassociates.com\/food-social2\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/09\/how-to-make-potato-kugel-12-576x720-1-150x150.jpeg\"\/>\t<p class=\"wprm-fallback-recipe-summary\">\n\t\t\t<\/p>\n\t<div class=\"wprm-fallback-recipe-equipment\">\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t<div class=\"wprm-fallback-recipe-ingredients\">\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t<div class=\"wprm-fallback-recipe-instructions\">\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t<div class=\"wprm-fallback-recipe-notes\">\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t<div class=\"wprm-fallback-recipe-meta\">\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<!--End WPRM Recipe-->","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Potato Kugel is often served for Passover.
