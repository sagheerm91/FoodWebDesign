Growing up there were two types of stews that my mom made. Brown stew\u2014where burnt sugar (a dark brown sugar caramel) was used to give the stew a rich brown color. And red stew or tomato paste stew\u2014where tomatoes and tomato paste came together to give the stew a rich red color. I love any version of stew. Red stew with chicken is really yummy.
