From chicken bites, to salad, to dipping sweet potato fries- it\u2019s delicious on everything. The key ingredient is ataulfo mangos, which are in season right now. They are also called champagne mangos or small yellow mangos. They have a very sweet flesh with a flavor profile that differs from a regular mango. You must use this mango for the vinaigrette, or it won\u2019t turn out the same. You will be in love once you try this recipe, just like me.<\/p>\n <!--WPRM Recipe 690-->\n<div class=\"wprm-fallback-recipe\">\n\t<h2 class=\"wprm-fallback-recipe-name\">Mango Vinaigrette<\/h2>\n\t<img decoding=\"async\" class=\"wprm-fallback-recipe-image\" src=\"https:\/\/aayushassociates.com\/food-social2\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/09\/1C563BEC-4CFE-47A6-8D84-DD4894F2AAC0_1_201_a-547x720-1-150x150.jpg\"\/>\t<p class=\"wprm-fallback-recipe-summary\">\n\t\t\t<\/p>\n\t<div class=\"wprm-fallback-recipe-equipment\">\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t<div class=\"wprm-fallback-recipe-ingredients\">\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t<div class=\"wprm-fallback-recipe-instructions\">\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t<div class=\"wprm-fallback-recipe-notes\">\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t<div class=\"wprm-fallback-recipe-meta\">\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<!--End WPRM Recipe-->","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Since creating it, I have been obsessed with this vinaigrette and have been eating it on everything.
