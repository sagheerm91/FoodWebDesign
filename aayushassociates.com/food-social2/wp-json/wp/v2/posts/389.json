This is not your grandma\u2019s cabbage of days gone by friends! Roasting cabbage is pure mealtime magic and transforms this humble veggie into an instant classic. You can prepare this well ahead of time, so you can forget about it until meal time is closer. Do not let the anchovy paste steer you away from this one, trust us, it adds a burst of umami and zero fishy flavor. Pairing that along with the fresh herbs and garlic in the wet rub is a must here. As with most cruciferous veggies, these wedges are best enjoyed right out of the oven while warm. The longer you let these wedges roast, the crispier those outer edges will get on both the cabbage and the prosciutto. Can we get a &#8220;YUM!&#8221; Keep an eye on the pine nuts, as those will burn fast, so make sure you get the wedges as \u201cdone\u201d as you want before adding those little nuggets of deliciousness. This recipe can easily be doubled if you are feeding a crowd, otherwise save the other half of the head for a later use.<\/p>\n <!--WPRM Recipe 750-->\n<div class=\"wprm-fallback-recipe\">\n\t<h2 class=\"wprm-fallback-recipe-name\">Roasted Prosciutto Cabbage Wedges<\/h2>\n\t<img decoding=\"async\" class=\"wprm-fallback-recipe-image\" src=\"https:\/\/aayushassociates.com\/food-social2\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/09\/IMG_1915-1-540x720-1-150x150.jpg\"\/>\t<p class=\"wprm-fallback-recipe-summary\">\n\t\t\t<\/p>\n\t<div class=\"wprm-fallback-recipe-equipment\">\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t<div class=\"wprm-fallback-recipe-ingredients\">\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t<div class=\"wprm-fallback-recipe-instructions\">\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t<div class=\"wprm-fallback-recipe-notes\">\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t<div class=\"wprm-fallback-recipe-meta\">\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<!--End WPRM Recipe-->","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Scrumptious cabbage with layers of salty prosciutto, roasted to perfection then topped with toasted pine nuts and a balsamic drizzle! &hellip; <\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":390,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"footnotes":""},"categories":[1],"tags":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/aayushassociates.com\/food-social2\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/389"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/aayushassociates.com\/food-social2\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/aayushassociates.com\/food-social2\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/aayushassociates.com\/food-social2\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/aayushassociates.com\/food-social2\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=389"}],"version-history":[{"count":1,"href":"https:\/\/aayushassociates.com\/food-social2\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/389\/revisions"}],"predecessor-version":[{"id":752,"href":"https:\/\/aayushassociates.com\/food-social2\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/389\/revisions\/752"}],"wp:featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/aayushassociates.com\/food-social2\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media\/390"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/aayushassociates.com\/food-social2\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=389"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/aayushassociates.com\/food-social2\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=389"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/aayushassociates.com\/food-social2\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=389"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
