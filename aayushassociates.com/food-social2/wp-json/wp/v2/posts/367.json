I think one of the best ways to help people cook more at home is to offer recipes that are not so rigid.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Cooking is a passion. Cooking is life. Cooking is creative. Cooking is instinctive.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But often if you aren\u2019t a person who loves to cook you get overwhelmed with feeling like you have to stick right to a recipe, you have to measure carefully and buy exactly what it calls for or it will fail. If that is you then try this recipe, you\u2019ll prepare a highly nutritious meal without stress!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Buy other veggies that are in season or that you love. Buy veggies you think your family (kids especially) will eat. The goal is to have at lease 4 different vegetables. If you don\u2019t have all the spices then just do your best.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Taste as you go, taste to see what your instinct tells you might be a great addition. Have fun. Use the knowledge gained and carry it forward into he next meal. Bon appetit<\/p>\n <!--WPRM Recipe 780-->\n<div class=\"wprm-fallback-recipe\">\n\t<h2 class=\"wprm-fallback-recipe-name\">Ayurvedic Lentil Soup<\/h2>\n\t<img decoding=\"async\" class=\"wprm-fallback-recipe-image\" src=\"https:\/\/aayushassociates.com\/food-social2\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/09\/IMG_0456-540x720-1-150x150.jpeg\"\/>\t<p class=\"wprm-fallback-recipe-summary\">\n\t\t\t<\/p>\n\t<div class=\"wprm-fallback-recipe-equipment\">\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t<div class=\"wprm-fallback-recipe-ingredients\">\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t<div class=\"wprm-fallback-recipe-instructions\">\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t<div class=\"wprm-fallback-recipe-notes\">\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t<div class=\"wprm-fallback-recipe-meta\">\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<!--End WPRM Recipe-->","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>If you have followed me for a while then you know I ADORE a recipe that is healthy and flexible. &hellip; <\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":369,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"footnotes":""},"categories":[1],"tags":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/aayushassociates.com\/food-social2\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/367"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/aayushassociates.com\/food-social2\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/aayushassociates.com\/food-social2\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/aayushassociates.com\/food-social2\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/aayushassociates.com\/food-social2\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=367"}],"version-history":[{"count":1,"href":"https:\/\/aayushassociates.com\/food-social2\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/367\/revisions"}],"predecessor-version":[{"id":782,"href":"https:\/\/aayushassociates.com\/food-social2\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/367\/revisions\/782"}],"wp:featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/aayushassociates.com\/food-social2\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media\/369"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/aayushassociates.com\/food-social2\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=367"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/aayushassociates.com\/food-social2\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=367"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/aayushassociates.com\/food-social2\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=367"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
