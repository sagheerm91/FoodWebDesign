Like our simple dhal, Rajma (the red kidney beans) is an emotion. Every family has their own version of it and trust me every version is delicious because this is what childhood memories are made of.This bowl of Rajma is a soul lifter for any day of the week. Absolutely bursting with flavor and comforting during the chilly evenings.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The flavor burst to this recipe comes from simple herbs, spices and more so from the slow saut\u00e9ing. Trust me, a little patience during saut\u00e9ing is all it takes to build flavors in Indian recipes. practice that and you\u2019ll be a pro at any Indian dish including this one.<\/p>\n <!--WPRM Recipe 762-->\n<div class=\"wprm-fallback-recipe\">\n\t<h2 class=\"wprm-fallback-recipe-name\">Indian Red Bean Soup (Rajma)<\/h2>\n\t<img decoding=\"async\" class=\"wprm-fallback-recipe-image\" src=\"https:\/\/aayushassociates.com\/food-social2\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/09\/20220303_125435_HDR3-587x720-1-150x150.jpg\"\/>\t<p class=\"wprm-fallback-recipe-summary\">\n\t\t\t<\/p>\n\t<div class=\"wprm-fallback-recipe-equipment\">\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t<div class=\"wprm-fallback-recipe-ingredients\">\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t<div class=\"wprm-fallback-recipe-instructions\">\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t<div class=\"wprm-fallback-recipe-notes\">\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t<div class=\"wprm-fallback-recipe-meta\">\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<!--End WPRM Recipe-->","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Today I am bringing another of our ever popular and a classic bowl of confort food!
