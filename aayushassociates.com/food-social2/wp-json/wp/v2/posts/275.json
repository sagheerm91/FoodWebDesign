These are inspired by flavors found in aloo tiki, a spiced potato patty topped with delicious chutneys commonly enjoyed in India. I\u2019ve infused these flavors into a healthy salmon cake. You can use canned, wild caught salmon or tuna, and even sardines for this recipe. I love topping these savory cakes with my avocado chutney during whole30 for a meal that is filled with proteins and healthy fats. When I\u2019m not on whole30, I enjoy it with a cooling yogurt sauce. Hope you enjoy this!<\/p>\n <!--WPRM Recipe 852-->\n<div class=\"wprm-fallback-recipe\">\n\t<h2 class=\"wprm-fallback-recipe-name\">Indian Style Salmon Cakes<\/h2>\n\t<img decoding=\"async\" class=\"wprm-fallback-recipe-image\" src=\"https:\/\/aayushassociates.com\/food-social2\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/09\/Indian-Style-Salmon-Cakes-615x720-1-150x150.jpg\"\/>\t<p class=\"wprm-fallback-recipe-summary\">\n\t\t\t<\/p>\n\t<div class=\"wprm-fallback-recipe-equipment\">\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t<div class=\"wprm-fallback-recipe-ingredients\">\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t<div class=\"wprm-fallback-recipe-instructions\">\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t<div class=\"wprm-fallback-recipe-notes\">\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t<div class=\"wprm-fallback-recipe-meta\">\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<!--End WPRM Recipe-->","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>These delicious and nutritious salmon cakes come together in a pinch and are rich in Indian flavors!
