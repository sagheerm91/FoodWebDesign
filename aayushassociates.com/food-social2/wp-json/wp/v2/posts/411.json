These Indian style stir fries are super healthy, nutrient and fiber rich and packed with flavor from spices. They come together really quickly! I like to chop up veggies over the weekend or use frozen veggies so I can make these for busy weekday dinners. You will love loading up your plates with these fresh and yummy veggies!<\/p>\n <!--WPRM Recipe 717-->\n<div class=\"wprm-fallback-recipe\">\n\t<h2 class=\"wprm-fallback-recipe-name\">Cabbage and Peas Stir Fry<\/h2>\n\t<img decoding=\"async\" class=\"wprm-fallback-recipe-image\" src=\"https:\/\/aayushassociates.com\/food-social2\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/09\/Screenshot_20230510-121005-462x720-1-150x150.png\"\/>\t<p class=\"wprm-fallback-recipe-summary\">\n\t\t\t<\/p>\n\t<div class=\"wprm-fallback-recipe-equipment\">\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t<div class=\"wprm-fallback-recipe-ingredients\">\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t<div class=\"wprm-fallback-recipe-instructions\">\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t<div class=\"wprm-fallback-recipe-notes\">\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t<div class=\"wprm-fallback-recipe-meta\">\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<!--End WPRM Recipe-->","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>If your only exposure to Indian food is at Indian Restaurants in the US, you may not have eaten these &hellip; <\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":412,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"footnotes":""},"categories":[1],"tags":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/aayushassociates.com\/food-social2\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/411"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/aayushassociates.com\/food-social2\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/aayushassociates.com\/food-social2\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/aayushassociates.com\/food-social2\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/aayushassociates.com\/food-social2\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=411"}],"version-history":[{"count":1,"href":"https:\/\/aayushassociates.com\/food-social2\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/411\/revisions"}],"predecessor-version":[{"id":719,"href":"https:\/\/aayushassociates.com\/food-social2\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/411\/revisions\/719"}],"wp:featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/aayushassociates.com\/food-social2\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media\/412"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/aayushassociates.com\/food-social2\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=411"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/aayushassociates.com\/food-social2\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=411"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/aayushassociates.com\/food-social2\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=411"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
