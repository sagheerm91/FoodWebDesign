In attempt to save us some money and for those of you that don\u2019t live close to a Cava, I made this Harissa Marinated Chicken. It is the perfect weeknight meal and is really simple to make.<\/p>\n <!--WPRM Recipe 807-->\n<div class=\"wprm-fallback-recipe\">\n\t<h2 class=\"wprm-fallback-recipe-name\">Harissa Marinated Chicken<\/h2>\n\t<img decoding=\"async\" class=\"wprm-fallback-recipe-image\" src=\"https:\/\/aayushassociates.com\/food-social2\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/09\/Harissa-Marinaded-Chicken-540x720-1-150x150.jpg\"\/>\t<p class=\"wprm-fallback-recipe-summary\">\n\t\t\t<\/p>\n\t<div class=\"wprm-fallback-recipe-equipment\">\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t<div class=\"wprm-fallback-recipe-ingredients\">\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t<div class=\"wprm-fallback-recipe-instructions\">\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t<div class=\"wprm-fallback-recipe-notes\">\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t<div class=\"wprm-fallback-recipe-meta\">\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<!--End WPRM Recipe-->","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>It is no secret that I am obsessed with Cava right now.
