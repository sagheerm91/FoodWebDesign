You can prep this salad in advance, even with the dressing added&#8230; infact, I would recommend that because it allows the Brussels sprouts to soak up the flavors. Don&#8217;t worry the salad won&#8217;t get soggy as the hearty brussels sprouts hold up well, making it a perfect salad\/appetizer to make or take to a party. It&#8217;s got a nice, refreshing tart &#8211; sweet dressing and the salty parmesan cheese just takes it to the next level. Hope you give it a try!<\/p>\n <!--WPRM Recipe 612-->\n<div class=\"wprm-fallback-recipe\">\n\t<h2 class=\"wprm-fallback-recipe-name\">Shaved Brussels Sprouts Salad with Maple Dijon Vinaigrette<\/h2>\n\t<img decoding=\"async\" class=\"wprm-fallback-recipe-image\" src=\"https:\/\/aayushassociates.com\/food-social2\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/10\/C99039FF-DCCC-408B-9A23-E5FE36D7147E-1-577x720-1-150x150.jpg\"\/>\t<p class=\"wprm-fallback-recipe-summary\">\n\t\t\t<\/p>\n\t<div class=\"wprm-fallback-recipe-equipment\">\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t<div class=\"wprm-fallback-recipe-ingredients\">\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t<div class=\"wprm-fallback-recipe-instructions\">\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t<div class=\"wprm-fallback-recipe-notes\">\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t<div class=\"wprm-fallback-recipe-meta\">\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<!--End WPRM Recipe-->","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>This no-cook Shaved Brussels Sprouts salad is easy to put together and is a great way to use Brussels Sprouts &hellip; <\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":489,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"footnotes":""},"categories":[1],"tags":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/aayushassociates.com\/food-social2\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/486"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/aayushassociates.com\/food-social2\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/aayushassociates.com\/food-social2\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/aayushassociates.com\/food-social2\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/aayushassociates.com\/food-social2\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=486"}],"version-history":[{"count":1,"href":"https:\/\/aayushassociates.com\/food-social2\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/486\/revisions"}],"predecessor-version":[{"id":614,"href":"https:\/\/aayushassociates.com\/food-social2\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/486\/revisions\/614"}],"wp:featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/aayushassociates.com\/food-social2\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media\/489"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/aayushassociates.com\/food-social2\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=486"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/aayushassociates.com\/food-social2\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=486"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/aayushassociates.com\/food-social2\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=486"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
