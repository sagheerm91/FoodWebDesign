They\u2019ve got a delicious \u201ccrust\u201d, and are made gooey and sweet using layers of apple butter and real apples. They\u2019re topped with a delicious and sweet crumb. These layers are perfect, and a bit healthier than traditional apple pie. Plus they\u2019re easy to make, and make your kitchen smell like heaven! I love serving these up with some caramel sauce and vanilla ice cream for the ultimate treat.<\/p>\n <!--WPRM Recipe 555-->\n<div class=\"wprm-fallback-recipe\">\n\t<h2 class=\"wprm-fallback-recipe-name\">Apple Butter Crumb Bars<\/h2>\n\t\t<p class=\"wprm-fallback-recipe-summary\">\n\t\t\t<\/p>\n\t<div class=\"wprm-fallback-recipe-equipment\">\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t<div class=\"wprm-fallback-recipe-ingredients\">\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t<div class=\"wprm-fallback-recipe-instructions\">\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t<div class=\"wprm-fallback-recipe-notes\">\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t<div class=\"wprm-fallback-recipe-meta\">\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<!--End WPRM Recipe-->","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>These are grain free, gluten free, dairy free and refined sugar free and taste AMAZING!
