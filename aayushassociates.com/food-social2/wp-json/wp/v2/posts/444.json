The best part, no nasty preservatives! It&#8217;s so easy and you will love how versatile this southwest seasoning is. It is so amazing for marinating meats or adding to potatoes for an extra zing of flavor! The options are endless. My favorite is marinating flank steak with this seasoning, avocado oil and lime juice overnight and then grilling it and making Southwest Steak Salads!
