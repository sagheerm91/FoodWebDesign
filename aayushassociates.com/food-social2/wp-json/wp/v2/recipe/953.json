We have  this 1-2x per month all winter long, its hearty and incredibly  delicious. You can use any leftover turkey that you\u2019ve roasted or you  can also use ground turkey &#8211; totally up to you. The best part about this  recipe is that it takes very little prep and can be done the night  before cooking. Toss all your ingredients in the ceramic insert of the  slow cooker and place in the fridge overnight. In the morning, put in  the base of the slow cooker and turn on low for 8 hours or high for 4  hours. I hope you enjoy this recipe as much as we do &#8211; can\u2019t wait to  <\/div><span style=\"font-family: var(--yummy-primary-font); font-size: 1em; color: var(--yummy-font-color); letter-spacing: var(--yummy-primary-font-spacing); text-transform: var(--yummy-primary-font-transform);\">hear what you think!<\/span><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>The Turkey Kale Soup recipe has been one of my more highly requested dinner recipes that I\u2019ve shared every year &hellip; <\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":360,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"closed","template":"","recipe-course":[98],"recipe-cuisine":[],"recipe-cooking-method":[],"recipe-tag":[],"recipe-key":[],"recipe-badge":[],"recipe-dietary":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/aayushassociates.com\/food-social2\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/recipe\/953"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/aayushassociates.com\/food-social2\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/recipe"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/aayushassociates.com\/food-social2\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/recipe"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/aayushassociates.com\/food-social2\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/aayushassociates.com\/food-social2\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=953"}],"wp:featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/aayushassociates.com\/food-social2\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media\/360"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/aayushassociates.com\/food-social2\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=953"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"recipe-course","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/aayushassociates.com\/food-social2\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/recipe-course?post=953"},{"taxonomy":"recipe-cuisine","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/aayushassociates.com\/food-social2\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/recipe-cuisine?post=953"},{"taxonomy":"recipe-cooking-method","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/aayushassociates.com\/food-social2\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/recipe-cooking-method?post=953"},{"taxonomy":"recipe-tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/aayushassociates.com\/food-social2\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/recipe-tag?post=953"},{"taxonomy":"recipe-key","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/aayushassociates.com\/food-social2\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/recipe-key?post=953"},{"taxonomy":"recipe-badge","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/aayushassociates.com\/food-social2\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/recipe-badge?post=953"},{"taxonomy":"recipe-dietary","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/aayushassociates.com\/food-social2\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/recipe-dietary?post=953"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
