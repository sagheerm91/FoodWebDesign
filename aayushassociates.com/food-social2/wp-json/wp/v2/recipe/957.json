I think one of the best ways to help people cook more at home is to offer recipes that are not so rigid.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Cooking is a passion. Cooking is life. Cooking is creative. Cooking is instinctive.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But often if you aren\u2019t a person who loves to cook you get overwhelmed with feeling like you have to stick right to a recipe, you have to measure carefully and buy exactly what it calls for or it will fail. If that is you then try this recipe, you\u2019ll prepare a highly nutritious meal without stress!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Buy other veggies that are in season or that you love. Buy veggies you think your family (kids especially) will eat. The goal is to have at lease 4 different vegetables. If you don\u2019t have all the spices then just do your best.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Taste as you go, taste to see what your instinct tells you might be a great addition. Have fun. Use the knowledge gained and carry it forward into he next meal.
