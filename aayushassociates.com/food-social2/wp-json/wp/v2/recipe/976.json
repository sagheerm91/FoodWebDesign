I was so excited last week to go to the store and see piles of asparagus and beautiful radishes. I was inspired to use all those ingredients to make a potato salad with a lemon and dill vinaigrette. I have another potato salad on the blog with similar flavors but this one is packed full of more flavors and complexities. Probably my favorite part of this salad is the dressing. I really could pour that stuff on everything. I would recommend adding the radishes right before serving because they tend to bleed pink on the potato salad. Feel free to add any of your favorite veggies to the salad and enjoy!<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>This Lemon, Dill and Asparagus Potato Salad basically remind me of all things Spring.
