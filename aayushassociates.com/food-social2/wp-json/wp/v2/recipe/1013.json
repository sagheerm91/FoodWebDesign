You can prep this salad in advance, even with the dressing added&#8230; infact, I would recommend that because it allows the Brussels sprouts to soak up the flavors. Don&#8217;t worry the salad won&#8217;t get soggy as the hearty brussels sprouts hold up well, making it a perfect salad\/appetizer to make or take to a party. It&#8217;s got a nice, refreshing tart &#8211; sweet dressing and the salty parmesan cheese just takes it to the next level.
