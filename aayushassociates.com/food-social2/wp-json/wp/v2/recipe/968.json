Imagine these served with my Steak Chimichurri, literally a perfect Whole30 meal. They absorb so many incredible flavors and are crispy on the outside yet rich and tender in the center. This recipe is featured in the 2020 New York Times Best Seller, \u201cCooking Whole30\u201c cookbook. For this recipe, try to stick to using russet potatoes. Many of you have asked about substituting sweet potatoes, but in all honesty, they just aren\u2019t as good. Russet potatoes are more porous than sweet potatoes which means they will soak up more of the chicken stock, ghee and garlic flavors. I find they also crisp up nicer than a sweet potato does. So, when preparing your grocery list, go russet. Preparing the potatoes is important in this recipe. First, make sure to scrub and rinse your potatoes. When slicing, it doesn\u2019t have to be a perfect hexagonal cylinder \u2013 that\u2019s all aesthetic. Making them uniform in size, however, is relatively important so the potatoes cook evenly and at the same rate of time. Soaking your potatoes for 5 minutes is also a key step in this recipe as it removes a lot of the starch and will get your potatoes nice and crispy. Why a cast iron? If you don\u2019t have a cast-iron pan, I highly recommend grabbing one. They are perfect for searing on the stovetop and then transferring to the oven. These Whole30 Velvety Fondant Potatoes are the perfect example. Lodge Cast Iron pans offer great quality pans at affordable prices and you can probably pick one up at your favorite grocery or home goods retail location.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>These Velvety Fondant Potatoes are so worth making \u2013 the perfect side dish on your Whole30.
