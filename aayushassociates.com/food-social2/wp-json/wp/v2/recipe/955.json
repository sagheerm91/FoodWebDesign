The recipe is vegetarian but you can substitute the vegetable broth with chicken broth and add some shredded chicken to the soup for added nutrition. I love sipping this soup on a rainy day or when I&#8217;m down with a flu as it is such a great immunity booster due to the Vitamin C from lemon juice.
