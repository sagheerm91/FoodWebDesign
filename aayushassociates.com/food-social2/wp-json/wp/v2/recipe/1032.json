They\u2019ve got a delicious \u201ccrust\u201d, and are made gooey and sweet using layers of apple butter and real apples. They\u2019re topped with a delicious and sweet crumb. These layers are perfect, and a bit healthier than traditional apple pie. Plus they\u2019re easy to make, and make your kitchen smell like heaven!
