These are inspired by flavors found in aloo tiki, a spiced potato patty topped with delicious chutneys commonly enjoyed in India. I\u2019ve infused these flavors into a healthy salmon cake. You can use canned, wild caught salmon or tuna, and even sardines for this recipe. I love topping these savory cakes with my avocado chutney during whole30 for a meal that is filled with proteins and healthy fats. When I\u2019m not on whole30, I enjoy it with a cooling yogurt sauce. Hope you enjoy this!<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>These delicious and nutritious salmon cakes come together in a pinch and are rich in Indian flavors!
