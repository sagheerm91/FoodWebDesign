<p>Most muffins are pretty much as indulgent as actual cake, and even &#8216;regular&#8217;-sized muffins are bigger than a cupcake. So if you&#8217;re at a bakery and you really WANT the muffin over a slice of cake, go for it. But if that cake is calling your name, it&#8217;s pretty much going to digest the same as that muffin&#8230;get it and savor it!</p>

<p>Ohhh mercy! This is a recreation of one of my ALL TIME favorite chocolate bars! It is seriously borderline addictive, but the healthy fat from coconut keeps you from eating the whole batch. This will become a refrigerator staple! (Note, you NEED a candy thermometer for this recipe!)</p>

<p>Each spoonful of this No Churn Apple Pie Ice Cream tastes like apple pie melting on your tongue. The flavors are a beautiful medley of apple, maple, brown sugar, cinnamon and gluten free graham cracker. It’s everything you love about apple pie in ice cream form. Best part is, it’s gluten free, nut free and egg free!!!</p>

<p>These are grain free, gluten free, dairy free and refined sugar free and taste AMAZING! They’ve got a delicious “crust”, and are made gooey and sweet using layers of apple butter and real apples. They’re topped with a delicious and sweet crumb. These layers are perfect, and a bit healthier than traditional apple pie. Plus they’re easy to make, and make your kitchen smell like heaven! I love serving these up with some caramel sauce and vanilla ice cream for the ultimate treat.</p>

<p>This lemon curd recipe is utter perfection. Like liquid gold it’s creamy, tangy, sweet&#8230;and the best part&#8230;egg free, in addition to gluten free and nut free of course. It could be vegan as well by using a non dairy milk of choice and vegan baking sticks.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>This Homemade Puff Pastry Dough recipe is absolutely incredible. It’s gluten free, it can easily be vegan and it is seriously amazing. It&#8217;s also actually quite simple, which is a welcome surprise because many other recipes are quite intense. Is it a little labor intensive? Sure, especially if you don’t own a food processor but I promise you, it can still be done; I do it all the time without a food processor and I will walk you through it step by step.q</p>
